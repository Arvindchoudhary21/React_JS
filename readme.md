# Learning React JS from youtube 

Important points ->
1. Use the function name in first letter as Capital nhi to error dega (for both vite and basic react) 
2. also agar tum html return kr rhe ho to .jsx use kro and sirf javascirpt return kr rhe ho to 
.js use kro ok (use jsx always in case of vite nhi to error milega)
3. file name ka bhi first letter capital use kro for best practice (dono me run kr gya small letter me hi
but ues capital for best practice)
